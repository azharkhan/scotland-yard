# What's this?

An unofficial digital version of the classic boardgame - [Scotland Yard](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/438/scotland-yard), made to play with friends over a call during the 2020 Quarantine.

In addition, this was done as a project to learn some web development with some friends as a project.

# Pre-requisites

You'll need the latest node.js version installed. Either use the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/), or if use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (my preferred installation method).

`brew install node` -- if using Homebrew

# Installation

1. Clone this repo from Github
1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages
1. Run `npm run dev` to start up a local server
1. Navigate to the server address as shown in any modern browser.

# Tools

This repo is locally developed and bundled using the awesome [parcel](https://parceljs.org) bundler in order to simplify tooling.

The design and plotting of all the points was completed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

# Inspirations

We're always standing on the shoulder of others who did this work before us, so I'm thankful for the following efforts, from where I picked up some assets.

In addition, the following videos and articles helped me narrow down my approach.
